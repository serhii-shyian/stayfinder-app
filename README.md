## üè° Project description

---
**This Accommodation Booking and Management System allows users to browse and book accommodations, manage rental inventories, and handle payments securely through Stripe. 
The system provides role-based access, enabling administrators to manage accommodations and bookings, while customers can manage their personal bookings. 
Real-time notifications about bookings and payments are delivered through a Telegram bot. 
Built with Spring Boot, Liquibase for database management, and Docker for deployment, it offers RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, 
JWT-based authentication, and robust handling of accommodation availability, with automated booking expiration checks and session management for payments.**
